# Todo In-Memory Python Console App

A command-line todo application written in Python that allows users to manage a list of tasks entirely in memory during program execution. The application supports adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as complete with a simple menu-driven interface.

## Features

- Add new tasks with descriptions
- View all tasks with completion status
- Update existing task descriptions
- Delete tasks from the list
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- All data stored in-memory only (no persistence)

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Ensure Python 3.13+ and UV are installed
4. Install dependencies with UV:

```bash
uv sync
```

Or if you want to run without installing:

```bash
uv run src/todo_app/main.py
```

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python -m src.todo_app.main
```

The application will present a menu with the following options:
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Update Task
4. Delete Task
5. Mark Task Complete
6. Exit

## Specification

This application was built following a spec-driven development approach with the following documents:
- Feature specification: `specs/001-todo-app/spec.md`
- Implementation plan: `specs/001-todo-app/plan.md`
- Implementation tasks: `specs/001-todo-app/tasks.md`

## Constraints

- All data is stored in memory only and is lost when the program exits
- Task descriptions are limited to 256 characters
- Sequential numbering is maintained for tasks even after deletion
- Application handles invalid input gracefully without crashing
